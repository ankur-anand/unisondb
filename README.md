## Overview

unisondb is a high-performance, replicated key-value store that blends the best of WALs, Memtables, and B-Trees to achieve:

* Blazing-fast writes without LSM compaction overhead.

* Optimized range queries with minimal disk I/O using B-Trees

* Efficient replication via gRPC WAL streaming & B-Tree snapshots

* Seamless multi-region scaling with rapid fail over.

* LOB support via chunked, transactional writes for large object handling.

* Flexible wide-column data modeling for dynamic, nested records


## Why is Traditional KV Replication Insufficient?

> Most traditional key-value stores were designed for simple, point-in-time key-value operations â€” and their replication 
models reflect that. While this works for basic use cases, it quickly breaks down under real-world 
demands like multi-key transactions, large object handling, and fine-grained updates.

### Key-Level Replication Only

Replication is often limited to raw key-value pairs. 
Thereâ€™s no understanding of higher-level constructs like rows, columns, 
or chunks â€” making it impossible to efficiently replicate partial updates or large structured objects.

### No Transactional Consistency

Replication happens on a per-operation basis, not as part of an atomic unit.
Without multi-key transactional guarantees, systems can fall into inconsistent states across replicas, 
especially during batch operations, network partitions, or mid-transaction failures.

### Chunked LOB Writes Become Risky

When large values are chunked and streamed to the store, traditional replication models expose chunks as they arrive. 
If a transfer fails mid-way, replicas may store incomplete or corrupted objects, with no rollback or recovery mechanism.

### No Awareness of Column-Level Changes

Wide-column data is treated as flat keys or opaque blobs. If only a single column is modified, 
traditional systems replicate the entire row, wasting bandwidth, 
increasing storage overhead, and making efficient synchronization impossible.

### Operational Complexity Falls on the User

Without built-in transactional semantics, developers must implement their own logic for deduplication, 
rollback, consistency checks, and coordination â€” which adds fragility and complexity to the system.

### Storage Engine Tradeoffs

â€¢	LSM-Trees (e.g., RocksDB) excel at fast writes but suffer from high read amplification and costly background compactions, which hurt latency and predictability.

â€¢	B+Trees (e.g., BoltDB,LMDB) offer efficient point lookups and range scans, but struggle with high-speed inserts and lack native replication support.
 
## How UnisonDB Solves This. :white_check_mark:

UnisonDB combines append-only logs for high-throughput ingest with B-Trees for fast and efficient range reads â€” while offering:

* Transactional, multi-key replication with commit visibility guarantees.
* Chunked LOB writes that are fully atomic.
* Column-aware replication for efficient syncing of wide-column updates.
* Isolation by default â€” once a network-aware transaction is started, all intermediate writes are fully isolated and not visible to readers until a successful txn.Commit().
* Built-in replication via gRPC WAL streaming + B-Tree snapshots.
* Zero-compaction overhead, high write throughput, and optimized reads.
